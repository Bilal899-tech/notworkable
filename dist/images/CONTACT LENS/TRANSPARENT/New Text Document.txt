Transparent contact lenses are generally of better quality compared to colored ones. They tend to last longer because they have a higher water content, which makes them more comfortable to wear for extended periods. If you want lenses that are durable and can be used for a long time, transparent lenses are a good choice. Always opt for high-quality lenses to ensure eye health and comfort.
